<h4 id="highlight">Highlights</h4>

<p>
    <b>Protein-protein interaction (PPI)</b> networks are essential for understanding 
	molecular mechanisms in biology, with applications in drug discovery, functional genomics, 
	and disease pathway identification. However, existing computational methods often rely on 
	static interaction datasets, lack multi-omics integration, and require high computational resources.
</p>

<p>
    To address these limitations, we present <b><i>PPI-OMEGA</i></b> (<u>P</u>rotein-<u>P</u>rotein <u>I</u>nteraction with <u>Om</u>ics-<u>E</u>nhanced <u>G</u>raph <u>A</u>utoencoder), a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE)-based framework
    that integrates RNA expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression data to enhance 
    PPI prediction. Our model generates biologically meaningful protein embeddings by leveraging 
    graph convolutional layers alongside multi-omics features.

<h5>ðŸŸ¢ Key Findings:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Multi-omics integration significantly improves predictive accuracy:</b> The combined RNA and protein expression model achieved the highest AUROC (0.9235) and AP (0.9318), outperforming RNA-only and protein-only models.</li>
    <li><b>Protein expression contributes more than RNA expression:</b> The model using only IHC protein expression performed nearly as well as the multi-omics model (AUROC = 0.9215, AP = 0.9297), while the RNA-only model had a more significant drop in performance.</li>
    <li><b>Multi-omics features enhance biological relevance:</b> The learned protein embeddings reflect functional characteristics, successfully distinguishing between housekeeping and context-dependent proteins.</li>
    <li><b>Graph-based embeddings improve model generalizability:</b> The PPI-OMEGA model captures structured protein-protein interaction patterns, reducing computational overhead while enabling potential downstream disease association studies and functional classification.</li>
</ul>


<p>
    This research highlights the power of <b>graph-based multi-omics integration</b> for improving 
    <b>disease-relevant PPI modeling</b> and advancing <b>precision medicine applications</b>. 
    Some future improvements include integrating protein sequence data and incorporating attention mechanisms
    to further refine interaction predictions.
