<h3>Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Enhance Protein-Protein Interaction Predictions Using Variational Graph Autoencoders</h3> 


<h4>Highlights</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Protein-protein interaction (PPI)</strong> networks are fundamental for understanding 
	molecular mechanisms in biology, impacting areas such as drug discovery, functional genomics, 
	and disease pathway identification. However, existing computational approaches often rely on 
	static datasets, fail to integrate multi-omics data, and struggle with scalability.
</p>

<p>
    To address these challenges, we introduce <strong>PPI-OMEGA</strong>, a <strong>Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE)-based framework</strong> 
    that integrates <strong>RNA expression profiles</strong> and <strong>immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression levels</strong> to enhance 
    PPI prediction. Our model captures biologically meaningful protein embeddings by combining 
    graph convolutional layers with multi-omics features.

<h5>ðŸŸ¢ Key Findings:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Model based on combined features achieved the highest AUROC (0.9057) and AP (0.9135).</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Multi-omics integration significantly enhances predictive accuracy</strong>, compared to RNA-only models.</li>
    <li>Our approach reduces <strong>computational overhead</strong> while facilitating <strong>disease association studies and functional classification</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This research demonstrates the potential of <strong>graph-based multi-omics integration</strong> for improving 
    <strong>disease-relevant PPI modeling</strong> and advancing <strong>precision medicine applications</strong>.
