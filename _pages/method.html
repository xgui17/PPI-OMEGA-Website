<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
    The <i>PPI-OMEGA</i> framework is designed to enhance protein-protein interaction (PPI) predictions 
    by integrating multi-omics data into a graph-based learning model. We leverage a 
    <b>Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE)</b> to capture complex dependencies in PPI networks, using 
    <b>RNA expression</b> and <b>immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression</b> as node attributes.

<h4>Dataset & Preprocessing</h4>
<p>
    We constructed our PPI dataset using the <a href="https://string-db.org/cgi/download?sessionId=bPc4lDeKY0hV">STRING database</a>, which contains interaction confidence scores 
    for protein pairs. The dataset was filtered to retain the top 5% high-confidence interactions and 
    mapped to human gene identifiers.
</p>
<p>
    Additional multi-omics features were integrated from <a href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download">The Human Protein Atlas</a>:
    <ul>
        <li><b>RNA Expression Data:</b> Processed from 35 tissue types, normalized using TPM values.</li>
        <li><b>IHC Protein Expression Data:</b> Derived from 45 tissues, discretized into 4 bins of different expression levels.</li>
    </ul>
    Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted separately for normalized RNA expression and protein expression features to reduce dimensionality.

<h4>Graph Construction</h4>
<p>
    Each protein was represented as a node, and edges were formed based on STRING database interactions. 
    Node attributes included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Structural Features:</b> Encoded from known PPI networks.</li>
    <li><b>Node Feature Data:</b> Preprocessed RNA and/or IHC protein values as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) Model</h4>
<p>
    Our model follows a standard VGAE framework:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Encoder:</b> Two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) extracts node embeddings.</li>
        <li><b>Latent Space:</b> A probabilistic layer learns a Gaussian distribution for protein representations.</li>
        <li><b>Decoder:</b> Dot product of embeddings reconstructs the adjacency matrix.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Training & Evaluation</h4>

<p>
    The model is trained using a <b>binary cross-entropy loss</b> with a 
    <b>Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</b> regularization term:
    \(\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{KL}\).
    We used the <b>Adam optimizer</b> with a learning rate of 0.001. 
    Training was stopped when validation loss did not improve by a minimum threshold 
    within a set number of epochs.
</p>

<b>Ablation Study</b>

<p>
    To assess the impact of multi-omics data integration, we conducted an ablation study during which we trained and evaluated the model under 
    four different feature input conditions:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Feature Set</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>No Features</td>
        <td>Only the network structure (adjacency matrix) was used as input.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>RNA Only</td>
        <td>RNA expression profiles were included as node attributes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Protein Only</td>
        <td>IHC protein expression levels were included as node attributes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Combined (RNA + Protein)</td>
        <td>Both RNA expression and IHC protein expression features were integrated.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The performance of each model variant was evaluated using <b>AUROC</b> and <b>AP (Average Precision)</b> scores. 
</p>

<!-- <p>
    Evaluation metrics included:
    <ul>
        <li><b>AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Curve):</b> Measures classification performance.</li>
        <li><b>AP (Average Precision):</b> Quantifies precision-recall performance.</li>
    </ul>
