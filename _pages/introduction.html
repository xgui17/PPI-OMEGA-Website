<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to cellular function, governing key processes such as 
    signal transduction, gene regulation, and metabolic pathways. Understanding these interactions provides 
    valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic target discovery.

<p>
    Traditional computational models for PPI prediction often rely on static datasets derived from high-throughput 
    experiments. However, these approaches face significant limitations, including an inability to account for 
    tissue-specific variations and a reliance on pre-existing interaction databases. As a result, they may 
    overlook functionally relevant interactions, limiting their applicability to dynamic biological systems.
</p>

<p>
    <i>PPI-OMEGA</i> addresses these challenges by integrating multi-omics data into a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) 
    framework. Unlike conventional methods, our approach leverages both <b>RNA expression profiles</b> and <b>immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
    protein expression data</b> to refine PPI predictions. By embedding multi-omics features within a graph-based learning 
    architecture, <i>PPI-OMEGA</i> generates biologically meaningful representations of protein interactions.

<p>
    This study details our methodology, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation metrics. 
    We compare our approach to existing models and discuss its potential impact on precision medicine, disease pathway 
    analysis, and functional genomics.
