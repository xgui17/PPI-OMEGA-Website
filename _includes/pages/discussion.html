<h5>游릭 Handling Dropped or Unused Data</h5>
<p>
   One limitation in our current approach is the treatment of dropped or unused data during preprocessing.
   While thresholding and PCA helped reduce noise and dimensionality, it may have also discarded
   potentially informative low-confidence PPIs or subtle expression variations. Besides, a proportion of proteins 
   were excluded because of the lack of corresponding multi-omics data. This exclusion may have led to information loss, 
   potentially biasing the model toward well-characterized proteins while overlooking biologically relevant but less-studied interactions.
</p>

<p>
   Future work could explore:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Adaptive thresholding techniques</b> to dynamically adjust inclusion criteria for interactions.</li>
    <li><b>Data imputation strategies</b> to retain valuable biological signals.</li>
</ul>

<h5>游릭 Challenges in Protein Expression Encoding</h5>
<p>
   Our reliance on immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression data introduces variability in quantification due to its imaging-based nature.
   More robust quantification techniques could improve the consistency and reliability of protein expression features.
</p>

<p>
   Potential improvements include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics for higher accuracy.</li>
    <li>Normalizing expression values across datasets to reduce noise.</li>
    <li>Incorporating time-series expression profiles to model dynamic PPI interactions.</li>
</ul>

<h5>游릭 Integrating Protein Sequence Data</h5>
<p>
   Our current model*does not include protein sequence features due to time constraints. 
   Most existing PPI prediction methods rely heavily on sequence data, whereas our approach 
   focused on RNA and protein expression. However, our results demonstrate that multi-omics 
   integration can significantly improve PPI prediction.
</p>

<p>
   Future work will benchmark our model against sequence-based methods to determine if integrating sequence data 
   further enhances accuracy.
</p>

<h5>游릭 Expanding Model Architecture</h5>
<p>
   Looking forward, we plan to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduce an <b>attention mechanism</b> to allow the model to focus on critical protein interactions.</li>
    <li>Incorporate additional omics data, such as <b>epigenetic modifications</b> or <b>metabolic profiles</b>.</li>
    <li>Address class imbalance by reducing false positive rates.</li>
    <li>Improve model <b>generalizability across tissues and conditions</b> to support precision medicine applications.</li>
</ul>
