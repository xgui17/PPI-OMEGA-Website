   <b>ðŸŸ¢ Enhancing PPI Prediction with Multi-Omics</b>
   <p>
      Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for understanding biological systems, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery. Traditional models primarily rely on sequence data, but our study demonstrates that incorporating RNA and protein expression significantly improves prediction accuracy. This multi-omics approach captures functional relationships beyond what sequence data alone can reveal. Future work will include integrating protein sequence features alongside multiomics data to build a more comprehensive and accurate PPI prediction framework.
   </p>

   <b>ðŸŸ¢ Handling Dropped or Unused Data</b>
   <p>
      Preprocessing decisions impact the quality of PPI predictions. While thresholding and PCA reduce noise, they may also remove informative low-confidence PPIs or rare expression patterns. To improve data retention and maintain biological signal integrity, future work will explore:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>Adaptive thresholding</b> to refine data inclusion dynamically.</li>
      <li><b>Data imputation</b> to recover missing but meaningful information.</li>
      <li><b>Feature selection</b> to balance dimensionality reduction and biological relevance.</li>
   </ul>

   <b>ðŸŸ¢ Improving Protein Expression Encoding</b>
   <p>
      Our reliance on immunohistochemistry (IHC) data introduces variability in protein quantification. More precise techniques will enhance the robustness of our model, including:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Using <b>mass spectrometry-based proteomics</b> for accurate protein quantification.</li>
      <li>Normalizing <b>RNA-protein expression values</b> across datasets.</li>
      <li>Incorporating <b>time-series expression data</b> to capture dynamic PPI interactions.</li>
      <li>Exploring <b>single-cell transcriptomics</b> to improve resolution in cellular studies.</li>
   </ul>

   <b>ðŸŸ¢ Integrating Protein Sequence Features</b>
   <p>
      While our study focused on multi-omics data, protein sequence information remains a fundamental component of PPI prediction. Many models leverage structural motifs and conserved domains for interaction analysis. Future work will integrate sequence-based features with multi-omics data to enhance accuracy and uncover novel PPIs relevant to disease research.
   </p>

   <b>ðŸŸ¢ Advancing Model Architecture</b>
   <p>
      Improving model interpretability and predictive power requires architectural refinements. Planned enhancements include:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Implementing <b>attention mechanisms</b> to prioritize biologically significant interactions.</li>
      <li>Expanding multi-omics integration to include <b>epigenetic and metabolic profiles</b>.</li>
      <li>Addressing <b>class imbalance</b> to minimize false positives in real-world applications.</li>
      <li>Enhancing <b>generalizability across tissues</b> for precision medicine applications.</li>
      <li>Exploring <b>graph-based deep learning</b> to model complex biological networks.</li>
   </ul>

   <b>ðŸŸ¢ Real-World Impact</b>
   <p>
      More accurate PPI prediction models have broad applications in biomedical research. Our findings contribute to:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>Drug discovery</b> â€“ Identifying novel drug targets and reducing off-target effects.</li>
      <li><b>Disease modeling</b> â€“ Mapping interaction networks in genetic disorders and cancers.</li>
      <li><b>Precision medicine</b> â€“ Personalizing treatments based on molecular profiles.</li>
      <li><b>Systems biology</b> â€“ Providing deeper insights into cellular mechanisms.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Moving forward, we will expand our datasets, refine our methodologies, and collaborate with experimental biologists to validate findings. By bridging computational predictions with experimental validation, we aim to create a biologically informed AI-driven tool for PPI analysis, driving new discoveries in molecular biology and therapeutic research.
