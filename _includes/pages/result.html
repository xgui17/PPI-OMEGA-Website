    <p>
    To evaluate the impact of different input feature combinations on model performance, we conducted an ablation study.
    Table 2 presents AUROC and AP scores for four configurations: using no features, using only RNA expression, using only protein expression,
    and combining both features.

    <b>üü¢ Model Performance Analysis</b>

    <p>
        Our results demonstrate that integrating both <b>RNA and protein expression features</b> led to the highest performance, 
        with an <b>AUROC of 0.9235 and an AP of 0.9318</b>. This confirms that incorporating multi-omics data enhances PPI 
        prediction compared to using RNA or protein expression alone. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Notably, the model trained with protein expression (IHC data) achieved an AUROC of 0.9057, surpassing the RNA-only 
        model (AUROC = 0.8837). This suggests that protein expression features provide a stronger signal for identifying 
        functional interactions. Meanwhile, the RNA-only model still showed competitive performance, reinforcing the value of 
        transcriptomic data in PPI prediction.

    <b>üü¢ Training Dynamics</b>
    <p>
        Throughout training, the model exhibited stable convergence patterns, with both AUROC and AP improving progressively 
        across epochs (Figure 1). The final multi-omics model outperformed the RNA-only and protein-only 
        configurations, underscoring the benefits of integrating complementary molecular data.

    <!-- <h4>Precision-Recall Performance</h4>
    <p>
        The Precision-Recall curve (Figure 2) highlights the model's ability to accurately classify interacting and 
        non-interacting protein pairs. The high **Average Precision (AP = 0.9198)** indicates strong predictive power, 
        further validating the advantages of multi-omics integration.

        Future improvements will focus on **optimizing feature weighting** to maximize predictive contributions from each 
        omics layer while minimizing potential redundancies.
