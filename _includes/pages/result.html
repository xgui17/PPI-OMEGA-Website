    <p>
    To evaluate the impact of different input feature combinations on model performance, we conducted an ablation study.
    Table 2 presents AUROC and AP scores for four configurations: using no features, using only RNA expression, using only protein expression,
    and combining both features.

    <b>üü¢ Model Performance Analysis</b>

    <p>
        Our results demonstrate that integrating both <b>RNA and protein expression features</b> led to the highest performance, 
        with an <b>AUROC of 0.9235 and an AP of 0.9318</b>. This confirms that incorporating multi-omics data enhances PPI 
        prediction compared to using RNA or protein expression alone. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Notably, the model trained with protein expression (IHC data) achieved an AUROC of 0.9215 and an AP of 0.9297, surpassing the RNA-only 
        model (AUROC = 0.8888, AP = 0.9026). This suggests that protein expression features provide a stronger signal for identifying 
        functional interactions. Meanwhile, the addition of RNA expression demonstrates diminishing return, which highlights needs to look for potential more relevant data.
    </p> 

    <b>üü¢ Training Dynamics</b>
    <p>
        To evaluate model convergence and performance stability, we tracked training dynamics by monitoring AP (Average Precision) scores across epochs (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The multi-omics model, which integrates both RNA and protein expression features, demonstrated faster convergence and higher final AP scores compared to single-feature models.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results indicate that:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The multi-omics model achieves the highest AP score and converges faster than RNA-only and protein-only models.</li>
        <li>The protein-only model performs almost as well as the multi-omics model, reinforcing the importance of protein expression features in PPI prediction.</li>
        <li>The RNA-only model lags in both convergence speed and final AP, suggesting that RNA expression alone provides limited predictive power.</li>
        <li>The model trained without node features struggles with stability and achieves the lowest AP score, confirming that incorporating biological features significantly improves PPI predictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>üü¢ Latent Representation Analysis</b>
    <p>
        To assess the biological relevance of the learned protein embeddings, we examined how the latent representations evolved during training. The model successfully captures biologically meaningful relationships, distinguishing between housekeeping and context-dependent proteins and structuring embeddings based on network connectivity.
    </p>

    <p>
        As shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, we visualized the UMAP projections of protein embeddings at different training epochs, classifying proteins as either housekeeping or context-dependent based on functional annotations. The results show that:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The separation between housekeeping and context-dependent proteins increases over training, indicating that the model progressively refines biologically meaningful representations.</li>
        <li>Some overlap remains, likely reflecting functional interactions between proteins that span both categories.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To further investigate how network structure influences embedding formation, we analyzed the variance of the latent representation mean (Œº) for highly connected versus sparsely connected proteins (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). The findings suggest that:
    </p>
    

    <ul>
        <li>Highly connected proteins converge faster, with their embeddings stabilizing early in training due to strong structural constraints.</li>
        <li>Sparsely connected proteins exhibit greater variance fluctuations before stabilizing, requiring more training epochs to reach a meaningful latent space representation.</li>
    </ul>
