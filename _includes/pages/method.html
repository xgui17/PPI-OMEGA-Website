    <b>游릭 Overview</b>
    <p>
        The <i>PPI-OMEGA</i> framework is designed to enhance protein-protein interaction (PPI) predictions 
        by integrating multi-omics data into a graph-based learning model. We leverage a 
        <b>Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE)</b> to capture complex dependencies in PPI networks, using 
        <b>RNA expression</b> and <b>immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein expression</b> as node attributes.
    </p>

    <b>游릭 Dataset & Preprocessing</b>
    <p>
        We constructed our PPI dataset using the <a href="https://string-db.org/cgi/download?sessionId=bPc4lDeKY0hV">STRING database</a>, which contains interaction confidence scores 
        for protein pairs. The dataset was filtered to retain the top 5% high-confidence interactions and 
        mapped to human gene identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional multi-omics features were integrated from <a href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download">The Human Protein Atlas</a>:
        <ul>
            <li><b>RNA Expression Data:</b> Processed from 35 tissue types, normalized using TPM values.</li>
            <li><b>IHC Protein Expression Data:</b> Derived from 45 tissues, discretized into 4 bins of different expression levels.</li>
        </ul>
        Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted separately for normalized RNA expression and protein expression features to reduce dimensionality.
    </p>

    <b>游릭 Graph Construction</b>
    <p>
        Each protein was represented as a node, and edges were formed based on STRING database interactions. 
        Node attributes included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structural Features:</b> Encoded from known PPI networks.</li>
        <li><b>Node Feature Data:</b> Preprocessed RNA and/or IHC protein values as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>游릭 Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) Model</b>
    <p>
        Our model follows a standard VGAE framework:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Encoder:</b> Two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) extracts node embeddings.</li>
            <li><b>Latent Space:</b> A probabilistic layer learns a Gaussian distribution for protein representations.</li>
            <li><b>Decoder:</b> Dot product of embeddings reconstructs the adjacency matrix.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    </figure>

    <b>游릭 Training & Evaluation</b>

    <p>
        The model is trained using a <b>binary cross-entropy loss</b> with a 
        <b>Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</b> regularization term:
        \(\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{KL}\).
        We used the <b>Adam optimizer</b> with a learning rate of 0.001. 
        Training was stopped when validation loss did not improve by a minimum threshold 
        within a set number of epochs.
    </p>

    <b>游릭 Ablation Study</b>

    <p>
        To assess the impact of multi-omics data integration, we conducted an ablation study during which we trained and evaluated the model under 
        four different feature input conditions:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature Set</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>No Features</td>
            <td>Only the network structure (adjacency matrix) was used as input.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>RNA Only</td>
            <td>RNA expression profiles were included as node attributes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protein Only</td>
            <td>IHC protein expression levels were included as node attributes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Combined (RNA + Protein)</td>
            <td>Both RNA expression and IHC protein expression features were integrated.</td>
        </tr>
        <caption><b>Table 1:</b> Description of Different Feature Sets used in Ablation Study</caption>
    </table>

    <p>
        The performance of each model variant was evaluated using <b>AUROC</b> and <b>AP (Average Precision)</b> scores. 
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
        Evaluation metrics included:
        <ul>
            <li><b>AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Curve):</b> Measures classification performance.</li>
            <li><b>AP (Average Precision):</b> Quantifies precision-recall performance.</li>
        </ul>
